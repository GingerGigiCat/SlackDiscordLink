# Chat between Slack and Discord

## If you're in hack club and looking for a live demo, either join [https://discord.gg/bm5VDG3bc4](https://discord.gg/bm5VDG3bc4) and [#hackclub-discord-bridge-management](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C07V1V34W48), or press the demo button to sea (pun intended) a video of it working


**Have you ever felt disappointed or confused by having to use slack? <p></p> Annoyed by another app open using up your RAM and your precious screen real estate? <p></p>**

Well suffer no longer.

This is very much in development, so not everything works and it's not being hosted yet so it'll only be running when I'm running it for now.

It was able to access any channel, but I had to restrict it due to issues with moderating it. I would like to add full moderation support and slack account linking in the future, but right now it has to be restricted.

Therefore, at the moment it can **only access [#hackclub-discord-bridge-management](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C07V1V34W48)**
